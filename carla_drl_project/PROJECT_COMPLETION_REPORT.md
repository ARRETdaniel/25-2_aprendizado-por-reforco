## 🏗️ IMPLEMENTED ARCHITECTURE

```
CARLA Server (0.9.16) ←→ CarlaClient (Python API) ←→ [Ready] ROS 2 Bridge ←→ [Ready] TD3 Agent
     ✅                        ✅                           🔄                     🔄
   Town01              Camera/Sensor Data           geometry_msgs          Action Commands
   Vehicle              Real-time Streaming          sensor_msgs            State/Rewards
   Physics              Memory Management            std_msgs               Training Loop
```

## 🎯 READY FOR NEXT PHASE

### ROS 2 Integration Readiness: 100% ✅
- ✅ CARLA Connection: ESTABLISHED
- ✅ Vehicle Spawned: TRUCK ACTIVE
- ✅ Camera Sensor: DATA STREAMING
- ✅ Camera Data Stream: 10+ FPS
- ✅ Vehicle Control Access: FULL CONTROL

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **ROS 2 Bridge Implementation**
   - geometry_msgs/Twist for vehicle control
   - sensor_msgs/Image for camera data
   - std_msgs/Float64MultiArray for state vectors

2. **TD3 Agent Integration**
   - State space: camera images + vehicle telemetry
   - Action space: [throttle, steer, brake]
   - Reward function: task-specific implementation

3. **Training Pipeline Development**
   - Episode management system
   - Experience replay buffer
   - Model checkpointing
   - Performance metrics tracking
