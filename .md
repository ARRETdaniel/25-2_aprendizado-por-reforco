help me continue the installation process for carla build to use with ROS 2 on  ubuntu 20.04

Before starting check our system setup, check if we have already intalled the carla build and ros 2 bridge is available and working.

Check the system before starting and read the attached file.

system: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS , conda env via conda activate carla-drl-env


My use scenario: CARLA + ROS 2 + DRL.
I will use carla to train e evaluate a DRL solution for a real life truck that use ROS 2. Thats why i need ROS 2 avaible as well in the CARLA .

If you need precise info fetch the documentations:
https://carla.readthedocs.io/projects/ros-bridge/en/latest/ros_installation_ros2/
https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/

My end goal will be to use CARLA to train and evaluate a DRL implementation and after that integrate with ROS 2,  based on the documentation and your knowledge what system configuration, envirment, languague, versions should i use?

Linux build
This guide details how to build CARLA from source on Linux. The build process is long (4 hours or more) and involves several kinds of software. It is highly recommended to read through the guide fully before starting.

If you come across errors or difficulties then have a look at the F.A.Q. page which offers solutions for the most common complications. Alternatively, use the CARLA forum to post any queries you may have.

Part One: Prerequisites
System requirements
Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04: The current dev branch of CARLA is tested regularly on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04. It may be possible to build CARLA in earlier Ubuntu versions but we recommend a minimum of version 20.04. CARLA has not been tested internally in Ubuntu 24.04, therefore we recommend to stay with a maximum of Ubuntu 22.04.
130 GB disk space: CARLA will take around 31 GB and Unreal Engine will take around 91 GB so have about 130 GB free to account for both of these plus additional minor software installations.
A high-performance GPU: CARLA places a high demand on the GPU, therefore it is recommended to use a minimum of an NVIDIA RTX 2000 series (e.g. 2070) or better with at least 6 Gb of VRAM, preferably 8 Gb or more.
A high-performance CPU: CARLA also benefits from a CPU with solid performance. We recommend a minimum of an Intel Core i7 with 4 or more cores (or equivalent).
Two TCP ports and good internet connection: 2000 and 2001 by default. Make sure that these ports are not blocked by firewalls or any other applications.
Python 3.8 or higher is recommended.
Software requirements
CARLA requires numerous software tools for compilation. Some are built during the CARLA build process itself, such as Boost.Python. Others are binaries that should be installed before starting the build (cmake, clang, different versions of Python, etc.). To install these requirements, run the following commands:

sudo apt-get update &&
sudo apt-get install wget software-properties-common &&
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test &&
wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key|sudo apt-key add
To avoid compatibility issues between Unreal Engine and the CARLA dependencies, use the same compiler version and C++ runtime library to compile everything. The CARLA team uses clang-10 and LLVM's libc++. Change the default clang version to compile Unreal Engine and the CARLA dependencies.

Ubuntu 22.04
sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy main universe"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential clang-10 lld-10 g++-12 cmake ninja-build libvulkan1 python python3 python3-dev python3-pip libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev tzdata sed curl unzip autoconf libtool rsync libxml2-dev git git-lfs

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang clang /usr/lib/llvm-10/bin/clang 180
Python dependencies
The CARLA build creates Python wheels for the API. These can be installed using PIP. Version 20.3 or higher is required. To check if you have a suitable version, run the following command:

pip3 -V
If you need to upgrade:

pip3 install --upgrade pip
You also need to install some Python dependencies:

pip3 install --user -r CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla/requirements.txt
Building Unreal Engine
This version of CARLA uses a modified fork of Unreal Engine 4.26. This fork contains patches specific to CARLA.

Be aware that to download this fork of Unreal Engine, you need to have a GitHub account linked to the Epic Games organization. If you don't have this link already set up, please follow this guide before going any further.

1. Clone the content for CARLA's fork of Unreal Engine 4.26 to your local computer:

    git clone --depth 1 -b carla https://github.com/CarlaUnreal/UnrealEngine.git ~/UnrealEngine_4.26
Note

Since github doesn't allow authentication with usename/password anymore, a personal authentication token can be used to clone the UnrealEngine repository. Here's the command to clone with OAuth.

    git clone --depth 1 -b carla https://oauth2:TOKEN@github.com/CarlaUnreal/UnrealEngine.git ~/UnrealEngine_4.26
2. Navigate into the directory where you cloned the Unreal Engine repository:

    cd ~/UnrealEngine_4.26
3. Set up and build with make. This may take an hour or two depending on your system.

    ./Setup.sh && ./GenerateProjectFiles.sh && make
Warning

Do not use -j tag to use all processor cores, e.g., make -j$(nproc). This will cause the build to fail. Clang will use all available cores anyway.

4. Open the Editor to check that Unreal Engine has been installed properly.

    cd ~/UnrealEngine_4.26/Engine/Binaries/Linux && ./UE4Editor
Building CARLA
Note

Downloading aria2 with sudo apt-get install aria2 will speed up the following commands.

Clone the CARLA repository
Clone the ue4-dev branch of the CARLA repository with the following command:

        git clone -b ue4-dev https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla
You can download the repository as a ZIP archive directly from the CARLA GitHub repository page if you prefer not to use Git.

Note

The master branch contains the latest official release of CARLA, while the ue4-dev branch has all the latest development updates. Previous CARLA versions are tagged with the version name. Always remember to check the current branch in git with the command git branch.

Download the CARLA content
CARLA comes with a large repository of 3D assets including maps, vehicles and pedestrians. To work on a build-from source version of CARLA you need to download a version of the content corresponding to your current update of the CARLA code.

If you are working on the latest updates of the ue4-dev branch you will need to download the latest version of the content. There are two ways to achieve this:

1. Using the content update script: This script downloads the latest package of the CARLA content as a tar.gz archive and decompresses the archive into the CARLA_ROOT/Unreal/CarlaUE4/Content/Carla directory:

./Update.sh
2. Using Git: Using Git, you will establish a git repository for the content in the CARLA_ROOT/Unreal/CarlaUE4/Content/Carla directory. This is the preferred method if you intend to commit content updates to CARLA (or your own fork of CARLA). From the root directory of the CARLA code repository, run the following command (if you have your own fork of the CARLA content, change the target remote repository accordingly):

git clone https://bitbucket.org/carla-simulator/carla-content Unreal/CarlaUE4/Content/Carla
Downloading the assets in an archive for a specific CARLA version
You may want to download the assets for a specific CARLA version for some purposes:

From the root CARLA directory, navigate to /Util/ContentVersions.txt. This document contains the links to the assets for all CARLA releases.
Extract the assets in Unreal\CarlaUE4\Content\Carla. If the path doesn't exist, create it.
Extract the file with a command similar to the following:
tar -xvzf <assets_archive>.tar.gz.tar -C /path/to/carla/Unreal/CarlaUE4/Content/Carla
Set the Unreal Engine environment variable
For CARLA to locate the correct installation of Unreal Engine, an environment variable is needed.

To set the variable for this session only:

export UE4_ROOT=~/UnrealEngine_4.26
You may want to set the environment variable in your .bashrc or .profile, so that it is always set. Open .bashrc or .profile with gedit and add the line above near the end of the file and save:

cd ~
gedit .bashrc # or .profile
Build CARLA with Make
The following commands should be run from the root folder of the CARLA repository that you earlier downloaded or cloned with git. There are two parts to the build process for CARLA, compiling the client and compiling the server.

1. Compile the Python API client
The Python API client grants control over the simulation. Compilation of the Python API client is required the first time you build CARLA and again after you perform any updates. After the client is compiled, you will be able to run scripts to interact with the simulation.

The following command compiles the Python API client:

make PythonAPI
Building the Python API for a specific Python version

The above command will build the Python API for the system Python version. You can target a specific version of Python up to 3.11 with the following instructions:

Install the target Python version at the system level with the development headers and the distutils, replace X with the desired version:
# The Deadsnakes PPA may be needed for some Python versions
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update

# Replace the X for the desired Python version
sudo apt install python3.X python3.X-dev python3.X-distutils
We recommend to disable any virtual environment managers such as PyEnv, Rye or Conda. These might interfere with the installation.

Then run the following command in the root CARLA root directory:

# Delete versions as required
make PythonAPI ARGS="--python-version=3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11"
For Python 3.12 and 3.13: the distutils library does not exist for Ubuntu and therefore setuptools may need to be updated, run the following commands to update setuptools:
sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-dev python3.12-venv
python3.12 -m ensurepip --upgrade
python3.12 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# Then run make from the CARLA root directory
make PythonAPI ARGS="--python-version=3.12"
If you are using a non-standard Python installation or a Python virtual environment manager like PyEnv, Rye or Conda. Instead of the --python-version argument it may be better to use the --python-root argument (you can locate the installation using which python3):
make PythonAPI ARGS="--python-root=/path/to/python/installation"
The CARLA Python API wheel will be generated in CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla/dist. The name of the wheel will depend upon the current CARLA version and the chosen Python version. Install the wheel with PIP:

# CARLA 0.9.16, Python 3.8
pip3 install CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.16-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl

# CARLA 0.9.16, Python 3.10
#pip3 install CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.16-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
Warning

Issues can arise through the use of different methods to install the CARLA client library and having different versions of CARLA on your system. It is recommended to use virtual environments when installing the .whl and to uninstall any previously installed client libraries before installing new ones.

2. Compile the server
The following command compiles and launches the Unreal Engine editor. Run this command each time you want to launch the server or use the Unreal Engine editor:

make launch
During the first launch, the editor may show warnings regarding shaders and mesh distance fields. These take some time to be loaded and the map will not show properly until then. Subsequent launches of the editor will be quicker.

ue4_editor_open

3. Start the simulation
Press Play to start the server simulation. The camera can be moved with WASD keys and rotated by clicking the scene while moving the mouse around.

Test the simulator using the example scripts inside PythonAPI\examples. With the simulator running, open a new terminal for each script and run the following commands to spawn some life into the town and create a weather cycle:

# Terminal A
cd PythonAPI/examples
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 generate_traffic.py

# Terminal B
cd PythonAPI/examples
python3 dynamic_weather.py
Important

If the simulation is running at a very low FPS rate, go to Edit -> Editor preferences -> Performance in the Unreal Engine editor and disable Use less CPU when in background.

Additional Make options
There are more make commands that you may find useful. Find them in the table below:

Command	Description
make help	Prints all available commands.
make launch	Launches CARLA server in Editor window.
make PythonAPI	Builds the CARLA client.
make LibCarla	Prepares the CARLA library to be imported anywhere.
make package	Builds CARLA and creates a packaged version for distribution.
make clean	Deletes all the binaries and temporals generated by the build system.
make rebuild	make clean and make launch both in one command.
Read the F.A.Q. page or post in the CARLA forum for any issues regarding this guide.

Up next, learn how to update the CARLA build or take your first steps in the simulation, and learn some core concepts.



ROS bridge installation for ROS 2
This section is a guide on how to install the ROS bridge on Linux for use with ROS 2. You will find the prerequisites, installation steps, how to run a basic package to make sure everything is working well and commands to run tests.

Before you begin
ROS bridge installation
Run the ROS bridge
Testing
Important

ROS is still experimental for Windows. It has only been tested for Linux systems.

Before you begin
You will need to fulfill the following software requirements before using the ROS bridge:

Install ROS:
ROS 2 Foxy — For Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)
Additional ROS packages may be required depending on your needs. rviz is highly recommended to visualize ROS data.
CARLA 0.9.11 or later — Previous versions are not compatible with the ROS bridge. Follow the quick start installation or make the build for Linux. It is recommended to match the ROS bridge version to the CARLA version when possible.
ROS bridge installation
Note

The Debian package installation is not yet available for ROS 2.

1. Set up the project directory and clone the ROS bridge repository and submodules:

    mkdir -p ~/carla-ros-bridge && cd ~/carla-ros-bridge
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-bridge.git src/ros-bridge
2. Set up the ROS environment:

    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
3. Install the ROS dependencies:

    rosdep update
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r
4. Build the ROS bridge workspace using colcon:

    colcon build
Run the ROS bridge
1. Start a CARLA server according to the installation method used to install CARLA:

    # Package version in carla root folder
    ./CarlaUE4.sh

    # Debian installation in `opt/carla-simulator/`
    ./CarlaUE4.sh

    # Build from source version in carla root folder
    make launch
2. Add the correct CARLA modules to your Python path:

    export CARLA_ROOT=<path-to-carla>
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-<carla_version_and_arch>.egg:$CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla
3. Add the source path for the ROS bridge workspace:

    source ./install/setup.bash
4. In another terminal, start the ROS 2 bridge. You can run one of the two options below:

    # Option 1, start the basic ROS bridge package
    ros2 launch carla_ros_bridge carla_ros_bridge.launch.py

    # Option 2, start the ROS bridge with an example ego vehicle
    ros2 launch carla_ros_bridge carla_ros_bridge_with_example_ego_vehicle.launch.py
Note

If you receive the error: ImportError: no module named CARLA then the path to the CARLA Python API is missing. The apt installation sets the path automatically, but it may be missing for other installations.

You will need to add the appropriate .egg file to your Python path. You will find the file in either /PythonAPI/ or /PythonAPI/dist/ depending on the CARLA installation. Execute the following command with the complete path to the .egg file, using the file that corresponds to your installed version of Python:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/carla/PythonAPI/<your_egg_file>

It is recommended to set this variable permanently by adding the previous line to your .bashrc file.

To check the CARLA library can be imported correctly, run the following command and wait for a success message:

    python3 -c 'import carla;print("Success")' # python3

    or

    python -c 'import carla;print("Success")' # python2
Testing
To execute tests using colcon:

1. Build the package:

    colcon build --packages-up-to carla_ros_bridge
2. Run the tests:

    launch_test carla_ros_bridge/test/ros_bridge_client_ros2_test.py
