# TD3 Autonomous Vehicle Training - Task Progress

## ✅ COMPLETED: Reward Function Validation (Oct 26, 2024)

### Issues Found and Fixed

1. **✅ FIXED: Safety Weight Sign Inversion**
   - **Problem:** Safety weight was -100.0 (should be +100.0)
   - **Impact:** Standing still gave +50.0 reward instead of -50.0
   - **Solution:** Changed safety weight to +100.0 in training_config.yaml
   - **Validation:** Empirically confirmed - standing still now gives -53.00 reward

2. **✅ FIXED: Goal Completion Bonus Scaling**
   - **Problem:** Goal bonus = 100.0 × 10.0 = 1,000 (should be 100)
   - **Impact:** Goal bonus 10× too large, could bias policy toward risky behavior
   - **Solution:** Reduced base bonus from 100.0 to 10.0
   - **Validation:** Configuration verified with grep

3. **✅ FIXED: Waypoint Bonus Scaling**
   - **Problem:** Waypoint bonus = 10.0 × 10.0 = 100 (same as goal!)
   - **Impact:** Waypoints valued equally to goal completion
   - **Solution:** Reduced base bonus from 10.0 to 1.0
   - **Validation:** Configuration verified, ratio now 100:10 = 10:1

### Validation Results

**Empirical Test (800 timesteps):**
- ✅ Standing still gives -53.00 reward (strongly negative)
- ✅ Forward movement gives -2.96 reward (50-point improvement)
- ✅ Safety component: -50.00 when stationary (correct sign)
- ✅ All reward components have correct signs and magnitudes
- ✅ Training completed without crashes or errors

**Documentation Created:**
- ✅ REWARD_FUNCTION_VALIDATION_ANALYSIS.md (25 pages, comprehensive)
- ✅ QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md (2 pages, quick reference)
- ✅ ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md (executive summary)
- ✅ EMPIRICAL_VALIDATION_RESULTS.md (test results and recommendations)
- ✅ verify_reward_fix.py (automated verification script)

**Status:** **READY TO PROCEED WITH FULL TRAINING** ✅

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS: Validation Training (20k Steps)

### CRITICAL: Run Validation Before Full Training

**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation on laptop before committing to 1M-step run on supercomputer.

### Immediate Actions

1. **Run 20k-Step Validation Training** ⏰ **DO THIS FIRST**
   ```bash
   cd av_td3_system
   ./scripts/run_validation_training.sh
   ```
   - **Duration:** ~2-3 hours on laptop
   - **Storage:** ~500 MB (logs + checkpoints)
   - **Evaluations:** 10 checkpoints (every 2k steps)
   - **Data Collection:**
     - CNN feature statistics (every 100 steps)
     - Waypoint coordinates and distances
     - Reward component breakdown
     - Vehicle state (speed, lateral deviation, heading)
     - Episode statistics

2. **Analyze Validation Results**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/analyze_validation_run.py \
     --log-file data/logs/validation_training_20k_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log \
     --output-dir data/validation_analysis
   ```
   - **Generates:**
     - Comprehensive validation report (pass/fail for each criterion)
     - Visualization plots (rewards, speed, CNN features, waypoints)
     - Overall verdict: Ready for full training? YES/NO

3. **Review Validation Report**
   - Check: `data/validation_analysis/validation_report.txt`
   - View plots: `data/validation_analysis/validation_analysis.png`
   - Monitor TensorBoard: `tensorboard --logdir data/logs`

4. **Decision Point: Proceed to Full Training?**

   **✅ IF ALL VALIDATION CHECKS PASS:**
   - Proceed to full 1M-step training on supercomputer
   - Use validated configuration without changes

   **🛑 IF ANY VALIDATION CHECK FAILS:**
   - DO NOT proceed to full training
   - Review failed checks in validation report
   - Fix identified issues
   - Re-run 20k validation training
   - Only proceed after all checks pass

## 📊 20k Validation Training Checklist

### Data Collection Verification ✅

During the 20k-step run, the following data will be automatically collected:

- [ ] **CNN Features** (every 100 steps)
  - L2 norm, mean, std, range
  - Verify features are not constant/degenerate

- [ ] **Waypoint Data** (every 10 steps)
  - Coordinates in vehicle frame (x, y)
  - Distances to waypoints
  - Verify waypoints are ahead (x > 0) and spatially sensible

- [ ] **Reward Components** (every 10 steps)
  - Efficiency, lane keeping, comfort, safety, progress
  - Verify standing still gives negative reward (~-53)
  - Verify safety component is negative when stationary (~-50)

- [ ] **Vehicle State** (every 10 steps)
  - Speed (km/h), lateral deviation (m), heading error (rad)
  - Track speed improvement over time

- [ ] **Episode Statistics**
  - Total reward, length, collisions per episode
  - Track learning progress (reward trend)

### Automated Validation Checks (Pass/Fail)

The analysis script will automatically verify:

- [ ] **Reward Function** ✅
  - Standing still (< 1 km/h) → negative reward
  - Moving (> 5 km/h) → better reward than stationary
  - Safety component negative when stationary

- [ ] **CNN Features** ✅
  - Features not constant (std > 0.01)
  - Features not degenerate (mean L2 norm > 0.1)
  - Features show temporal variation

- [ ] **Waypoints** ✅
  - >80% of waypoints ahead of vehicle (x > 0)
  - Waypoints within reasonable distance (< 50m)
  - Waypoints show spatial variation

- [ ] **Learning Progress** ✅
  - Episode rewards show upward trend
  - Average speed increases over time
  - Statistical significance (Spearman correlation test)

### Success Indicators (What to Look For)

**Early Phase (Steps 1-10,000):** EXPLORATION
- ✅ Vehicle mostly stationary (0-5 km/h) - EXPECTED
- ✅ Reward consistently negative (~-53) - CORRECT
- ✅ Random actions filling replay buffer - NORMAL
- ❌ Vehicle moving consistently - NOT EXPECTED (random actions)

**Late Phase (Steps 10,001-20,000):** LEARNING
- ✅ Average speed increases (5 → 15+ km/h) - GOOD
- ✅ Rewards improve (-53 → -20 or better) - LEARNING
- ✅ Episodes last longer (more progress) - GOOD
- ✅ Some episodes reach waypoints/goal - EXCELLENT

**Red Flags (Require Immediate Fix):**
- 🛑 Standing still gives **positive reward** - BUG REGRESSION
- 🛑 Safety component **positive when stationary** - SIGN BUG
- 🛑 CNN features constant (std < 0.01) - DEGENERATE
- 🛑 All waypoints behind vehicle (x < 0) - COORDINATE BUG
- 🛑 No learning improvement after 20k steps - HYPERPARAMETER ISSUE

---

## 📊 Training Monitoring Checklist

### Success Indicators ✅
- [ ] Average episode reward increases over time
- [ ] Average speed increases from ~0 km/h to 20-30 km/h
- [ ] Success rate (goal reached) > 70% after 500k steps
- [ ] Collision rate < 10% after 500k steps
- [ ] Training completes without crashes

### Warning Signs ⚠️
- [ ] Average speed stays near zero after 50k+ steps → Reward bug regression
- [ ] Collision rate increases rapidly → Safety penalties insufficient
- [ ] Goal not reached after 500k+ steps → Goal bonus too small
- [ ] Episode reward plateaus below zero → Hyperparameter tuning needed

## 🔧 Optional Enhancements (Not Required for Training)

### 1. Unit Tests for Reward Function
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** MEDIUM (helpful for future development)

Create `tests/test_reward_function.py`:
- test_standing_still_penalty()
- test_goal_bonus_magnitude()
- test_waypoint_bonus_magnitude()
- test_collision_penalty_dominates()
- test_velocity_gating()

### 2. Reward Component Logging
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** LOW (current debug logging sufficient)

Add DEBUG-level logging in `reward_functions.py`:
```python
if self.debug:
    logging.debug(f"[Reward Components] "
                 f"Eff={efficiency:.2f} | "
                 f"Lane={lane_keeping:.2f} | "
                 f"Comfort={comfort:.2f} | "
                 f"Safety={safety:.2f} | "
                 f"Progress={progress:.2f}")
```

### 3. Reward Visualization Script
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** LOW (can be done after training)

Create `scripts/visualize_rewards.py`:
- Plot reward components over time
- Useful for debugging training issues
