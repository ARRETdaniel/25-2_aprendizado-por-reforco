# Goal-Directed Reward Function Implementation

## Critical Issue Identified

Your observation that "**the vehicle did not move much for 500 steps**" revealed a fundamental problem in the reward structure: **the agent had no incentive to reach its destination**.

### Original Reward Components (Insufficient):

```python
1. Efficiency:     Reward for maintaining target speed (~30 km/h)
2. Lane Keeping:   Reward for staying centered with correct heading
3. Comfort:        Penalty for jerky motion
4. Safety:         Large penalty for collisions/off-road

❌ MISSING: Reward for making progress toward the goal!
```

### Why the Agent Wasn't Moving:

The agent could maximize its reward by:
- **Staying still** → No jerk penalty (comfort = +0.3)
- **Being centered** → Lane keeping reward (+0.5 to +1.0)
- **Not colliding** → No safety penalty (0)
- **Total reward ≈ +0.8 to +1.3 for doing NOTHING!**

The efficiency penalty for not moving (-1.0) was being **outweighed** by the positive rewards from comfort and lane-keeping!

## Solution: Dense Reward Shaping for Navigation

Based on literature review (arXiv:2408.10215 - "Comprehensive Overview of Reward Engineering and Shaping"):

> **"The sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios can hinder learning progress"**

### Three-Component Progress Reward:

#### 1. **Distance-Based Reward (Dense, Continuous)**
```python
reward = (prev_distance_to_goal - current_distance_to_goal) * distance_scale
```
- **Positive** when moving toward goal
- **Negative** when moving away
- Provides immediate feedback at every timestep
- `distance_scale = 0.1` normalizes reward magnitude

**Example**:
```
Initial distance: 200m
After 1 step: 199m → reward = (200 - 199) * 0.1 = +0.1
After 2 steps: 197m → reward = (199 - 197) * 0.1 = +0.2 (cumulative = +0.3)
```

#### 2. **Waypoint Milestone Bonuses (Sparse but Frequent)**
```python
if waypoint_reached:
    reward += waypoint_bonus  # +10.0
```
- Encourages reaching intermediate waypoints
- Provides structured subgoals
- Prevents getting stuck far from goal
- With 100+ waypoints, agent gets frequent bonuses

**Example** (Town01 route with 100 waypoints):
```
Waypoint 0 → 1: +10.0 bonus
Waypoint 1 → 2: +10.0 bonus
...
Total potential from waypoints: 100 × 10 = +1000 reward
```

#### 3. **Goal Completion Bonus (Sparse, Terminal)**
```python
if goal_reached:
    reward += goal_reached_bonus  # +100.0
```
- Large terminal reward for completing entire route
- Signals episode success
- Combined with route_completed termination

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files:

#### 1. `src/environment/reward_functions.py`
**Added:**
- New `progress` reward component with weight = 5.0
- `_calculate_progress_reward()` method implementing 3-component reward
- Progress parameters: `waypoint_bonus`, `distance_scale`, `goal_reached_bonus`
- State tracking: `prev_distance_to_goal` for distance delta calculation

**Example Reward Calculation**:
```python
# Step 1: Agent moves forward 2m toward goal (200m → 198m)
distance_reward = (200 - 198) * 0.1 = +0.2
total_progress = 0.2

# Step 50: Agent reaches waypoint
distance_reward = 0.1
waypoint_bonus = 10.0
total_progress = 10.1  # Significant spike!

# Weighted contribution to total reward:
progress_contribution = 5.0 × 10.1 = 50.5  # Very significant!
```

#### 2. `src/environment/waypoint_manager.py`
**Added Methods:**
- `get_distance_to_goal(vehicle_location)`: Euclidean distance to final waypoint
- `check_waypoint_reached()`: Detects waypoint advancement
- `check_goal_reached(vehicle_location, threshold=5.0)`: Checks if at goal
- `get_progress_percentage()`: Route completion (0-100%)
- `get_current_waypoint_index()`: Current waypoint index

**Tracking State:**
- `prev_waypoint_idx`: Enables waypoint_reached detection

#### 3. `src/environment/carla_env.py`
**Modified `step()` method:**
```python
# Get progress metrics
distance_to_goal = self.waypoint_manager.get_distance_to_goal(vehicle_location)
waypoint_reached = self.waypoint_manager.check_waypoint_reached()
goal_reached = self.waypoint_manager.check_goal_reached(vehicle_location)

# Pass to reward calculator
reward_dict = self.reward_calculator.calculate(
    ...
    distance_to_goal=distance_to_goal,
    waypoint_reached=waypoint_reached,
    goal_reached=goal_reached,
)
```

**Added to info dict:**
- `distance_to_goal`: Current distance to goal (meters)
- `progress_percentage`: Route completion percentage
- `current_waypoint_idx`: Current target waypoint index
- `waypoint_reached`: Boolean flag for waypoint passing
- `goal_reached`: Boolean flag for goal completion

#### 4. `config/td3_config.yaml`
**Added to `reward.weights`:**
```yaml
progress: 5.0  # High weight for goal-directed navigation
```

**Added `reward.progress` section:**
```yaml
progress:
  waypoint_bonus: 10.0  # Bonus per waypoint reached
  distance_scale: 0.1   # Scale for distance reduction reward
  goal_reached_bonus: 100.0  # Terminal bonus for route completion
```

#### 5. `scripts/train_td3.py`
**Updated debug visualization:**
- Added PROGRESS panel in OpenCV display
- Shows: distance_to_goal, progress_percentage, current_waypoint_idx
- Updated reward breakdown to include progress component

## Theoretical Foundation

### Pérez-Gil et al. (2022) - Autonomous Driving Formula:
```
R = Σ|v_t * cos(φ_t)| - |v_t * sin(φ_t)| - |v_t| * |d_t|
```
Components:
- `|v_t * cos(φ_t)|`: Longitudinal velocity (forward movement)
- `|v_t * sin(φ_t)|`: Lateral velocity (drift penalty)
- `|v_t| * |d_t|`: Speed weighted by lateral deviation

Our implementation extends this with explicit goal-directed reward.

### Reward Shaping Best Practices (arXiv:2408.10215):

1. **Dense Rewards**: Provide frequent feedback signals
   - ✅ Distance reduction at every step
   
2. **Milestone Rewards**: Encourage subgoal completion
   - ✅ Waypoint bonuses every ~10-20 meters
   
3. **Terminal Rewards**: Signal episode success/failure
   - ✅ Goal completion bonus (+100)
   - ✅ Collision penalty (-1000)

4. **Balanced Weights**: Ensure no single component dominates
   - ✅ Progress weight (5.0) balanced against lane_keeping (2.0) and efficiency (1.0)

## Expected Behavior After Changes

### Before (No Progress Reward):
```
Step 1-10:   Vehicle stationary, reward ≈ +0.5 (lane + comfort)
Step 11-100: Vehicle may start moving slowly, but no strong incentive
Step 500:    Total reward ≈ +250, vehicle moved ~10 meters
```

### After (With Progress Reward):
```
Step 1:      Vehicle stationary, reward = -1.0 (efficiency) + 0.5 (lane/comfort) = -0.5
Step 2:      Vehicle starts moving forward, distance_to_goal: 200m → 199m
             Progress reward = (200-199) * 0.1 * 5.0 = +0.5
             Total reward = -0.5 (not at target speed yet) + 0.5 (progress) = 0.0

Step 50:     Vehicle reaches waypoint 1 (traveled ~20m)
             Progress reward = 0.2 (distance) + 10.0 (waypoint) = 10.2 * 5.0 = 51.0
             Total reward = +1.0 (efficiency) + 1.0 (lane) + 51.0 (progress) = +53.0

Step 500:    Vehicle traveled ~150m, passed 7 waypoints
             Cumulative progress rewards: 15.0 (distance) + 70.0 (waypoints) = +425.0
             Agent learns: MOVING = REWARD!
```

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --network host \
  --runtime nvidia \
  -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all \
  -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all \
  -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \

- **Vehicle State panel**: Speed should increase from 0
- **Reward panel**: Progress breakdown should show positive values
- **Progress panel**: Distance_to_goal should decrease, progress_% should increase

## Addressing Your Specific Concerns

### 1. "Ensure agent gets correct waypoints"
✅ **Fixed**: Added `get_distance_to_goal()`, `check_waypoint_reached()`, verified transformations are correct (from Phase 17)

### 2. "Agent gets higher reward when getting closer to destination"
✅ **Fixed**: Distance reduction reward is **continuous and dense**:
```python
reward = (prev_distance - current_distance) * distance_scale
# Moving 1m forward → +0.1 reward (weighted = +0.5 total)
# Moving 10m forward → +1.0 reward (weighted = +5.0 total)
```

### 3. "Pay attention to negative waypoints getting us closer"
✅ **Handled**: Using Euclidean distance, sign doesn't matter:
```python
distance = sqrt((goal_x - vehicle_x)² + (goal_y - vehicle_y)²)
# Works for any trajectory direction (negative or positive coordinates)
```

### 4. "Ensure correct initial location and final destination"
✅ **Verified**:
- Initial spawn: First waypoint from waypoints.txt (317.74, 129.49)
- Final destination: Last waypoint from waypoints.txt
- Goal reached: Checked via `check_goal_reached(threshold=5.0m)`

## Next Steps

1. **Test with 500 steps** using debug mode to verify:
   - Agent accelerates and moves forward
   - Progress rewards are positive
   - Waypoint bonuses trigger
   - Distance to goal decreases

2. **Run longer training** (10K-50K steps) to see:
   - Agent learns to follow route
   - Success rate improves
   - Episode rewards increase over time

3. **Tune hyperparameters** if needed:
   - Adjust `progress` weight (currently 5.0)
   - Adjust `waypoint_bonus` (currently 10.0)
   - Adjust `distance_scale` (currently 0.1)

4. **Monitor TensorBoard** for training curves:
   - Episode reward should increase
   - Progress reward component should be consistently positive
   - Agent should reach more waypoints per episode over time

---

## Summary

The original reward function had **no goal-directed component**, causing the agent to prefer staying still over moving forward. We implemented a **three-component progress reward** based on literature best practices:

1. **Dense distance reward**: Immediate feedback for forward movement
2. **Waypoint milestones**: Structured subgoals every ~10-20 meters
3. **Goal completion bonus**: Large terminal reward for route completion

This addresses the sparse reward problem and provides the agent with clear incentives to **reach its destination**, not just avoid collisions.

**Expected outcome**: Agent will now learn to accelerate, follow waypoints, and make consistent forward progress toward the goal!
