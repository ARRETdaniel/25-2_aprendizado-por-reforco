# üîß Quick Fix Guide - Reward Function Bug

**Status:** ‚ùå ONE CRITICAL BUG FOUND  
**Urgency:** HIGH - Fix before next training run  
**Time to Fix:** 5 minutes  

---

## üêõ The Bug

**Problem:** Goal completion bonus is scaled **10x too large**

```yaml
# Current (WRONG):
progress:
  goal_reached_bonus: 100.0
weights:
  progress: 10.0

Result: 100.0 √ó 10.0 = 1000 (should be 100)
```

**Literature Reference:** Ben Elallid et al. (2023) uses fixed bonus of **100** for goal completion.

---

## ‚úÖ The Fix

Open `config/training_config.yaml` and change:

```yaml
# BEFORE:
reward:
  weights:
    progress: 10.0
  
  progress:
    waypoint_bonus: 10.0
    distance_scale: 0.1
    goal_reached_bonus: 100.0

# AFTER:
reward:
  weights:
    progress: 10.0  # Keep same
  
  progress:
    waypoint_bonus: 1.0     # ‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGE: 10.0 ‚Üí 1.0
    distance_scale: 0.1     # Keep same
    goal_reached_bonus: 10.0  # ‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGE: 100.0 ‚Üí 10.0
```

---

## üßÆ Result After Fix

```python
# Goal reached reward:
10.0 (base) √ó 10.0 (weight) = 100.0 ‚úÖ CORRECT!

# Waypoint reached reward:
1.0 (base) √ó 10.0 (weight) = 10.0 ‚úÖ CORRECT!

# Ratio:
goal : waypoint = 100 : 10 = 10:1 ‚úÖ APPROPRIATE!
```

---

## üß™ Verification (Recommended)

After making the fix, verify it works:

```bash
# 1. Check config loaded correctly
python -c "
import yaml
with open('config/training_config.yaml') as f:
    cfg = yaml.safe_load(f)
    goal_bonus = cfg['reward']['progress']['goal_reached_bonus']
    progress_weight = cfg['reward']['weights']['progress']
    result = goal_bonus * progress_weight
    print(f'Goal bonus after weighting: {result}')
    assert result == 100.0, f'Expected 100, got {result}'
    print('‚úÖ Fix verified!')
"

# 2. Run unit test (if available)
pytest tests/test_reward_function.py::test_goal_bonus_scaling -v
```

## üìä Impact Analysis

| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Goal bonus magnitude** | 1000 | 100 | ‚úÖ 10x smaller (correct) |
| **Goal:waypoint ratio** | 100:1 | 10:1 | ‚úÖ More balanced |
| **Reward spike at goal** | Very large | Moderate | ‚úÖ Less disruptive to training |
| **Policy behavior** | May rush to goal | Balanced exploration | ‚úÖ Better learning |
