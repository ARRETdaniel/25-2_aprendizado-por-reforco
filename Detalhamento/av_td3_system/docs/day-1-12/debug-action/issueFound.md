While watching the debug window i think i have found something. While the vehicle is moving at correct location and doing expected behavior it is recerving correct reward for it, but when it does a bad behavior it reserves negative reward, great.
From the debug window i can see that the episode reward when it hest to 0 all past negative reward becomes positive reward. What i can see is, lots of positve reward for good behavior, car agent moviong towad goal with no lane invasion or some lane invasion but total reward from episode is still positive, but , when it does lane invasion and the total episode reward gets to zero instead of reserving episode reward -negative , the episode reward is becaming positive after a totally lane invasion or off road .

the agent seem to be exploiting some problem in our implemntation that is geving positive episode reward for bad behavior. Good behavior gives positive reward and positive total reward, but total episode reward is not computting for negative reward
