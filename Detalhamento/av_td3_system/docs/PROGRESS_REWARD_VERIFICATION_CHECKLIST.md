# Progress Reward Fix - Verification Checklist ‚úÖ

## Quick Verification Steps

### 1. Rebuild Docker Image
```bash
cd av_td3_system
docker build -t td3-av-system:v2.1-python310 -f docker/Dockerfile.av_system .
```
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started / ‚è≥ In progress / ‚úÖ Complete

---

### 2. Run Quick Test (200 steps)
```bash
docker run --rm --network host --runtime nvidia \
  -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all \
  -e PYTHONPATH=/workspace \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  td3-av-system:v2.1-python310 \
  timeout 60 python3 scripts/train_td3.py --scenario 0 --max-timesteps 200 --debug
```
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started / ‚è≥ In progress / ‚úÖ Complete

---

### 3. Verify Console Output

**Check these items in the console output**:

- [ ] ‚úÖ Progress reward appears in breakdown: `Progress=+X.XX`
- [ ] ‚úÖ Five components shown (not four): `Efficiency | Lane | Comfort | Safety | Progress`
- [ ] ‚úÖ Progress value changes between steps (not always 0.00)
- [ ] ‚úÖ No Python errors or exceptions
- [ ] ‚úÖ Vehicle spawns in correct position and orientation

**Example expected output**:
```
üîç [DEBUG Step   10] Act=[steer:-0.045, thr/brk:+0.234] | Rew=  +2.15 | ...
   üí∞ Reward: Efficiency=-0.82 | Lane=+1.45 | Comfort=+0.18 | Safety=-0.00 | Progress=+0.47
```

---

### 4. Verify OpenCV Window

**Check these items in the OpenCV debug window**:

- [ ] ‚úÖ Camera view displays correctly
- [ ] ‚úÖ Reward breakdown shows all 5 components
- [ ] ‚úÖ Progress appears in breakdown list
- [ ] ‚úÖ PROGRESS section shows metrics:
  - [ ] "To Goal: X.Xm" (distance to destination)
  - [ ] "Progress: X.X%" (route completion percentage)
  - [ ] "Waypoint: N" (current waypoint index)
- [ ] ‚úÖ No duplicate PROGRESS sections

**Example expected display**:
```
REWARD:
  Total: +2.150
Breakdown:
  efficien: -0.82
  lane_kee: +1.45
  comfort:  +0.18
  safety:   -0.00
  progress: +0.47  ‚Üê Should appear!

PROGRESS:
  To Goal: 127.3m
  Progress: 12.5%
  Waypoint: 5
```

---

### 5. Verify Progress Reward Behavior

**Test different scenarios**:

#### A. Vehicle Moving Forward
- [ ] ‚úÖ Progress reward positive when vehicle moves toward goal
- [ ] ‚úÖ Progress value increases with distance traveled
- [ ] ‚úÖ Example: `Progress=+0.15` for 1.5m forward

#### B. Vehicle Stationary
- [ ] ‚úÖ Progress reward near 0.00 when vehicle not moving
- [ ] ‚úÖ Example: `Progress=+0.00` or `Progress=-0.01`

#### C. Waypoint Reached (may not happen in 200 steps)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Large positive progress reward when waypoint reached
- [ ] ‚úÖ Console log appears: "üéØ Waypoint reached! Bonus: +10.0"
- [ ] ‚úÖ Example: `Progress=+10.15` (bonus + distance)

---

### 6. Compare with Previous Test Output

**Your previous test showed** (1000 steps):
```
Step 10-370:
- Progress component: ‚ùå MISSING
- Vehicle movement: 6.1m ‚Üí 5.5m (0.6m)
- Speed: 0.0-1.7 km/h (mostly 0.0)
- Reward: +0.05 to +0.15
```

**After fix, you should see**:
```
Step 10-200:
- Progress component: ‚úÖ VISIBLE (e.g., Progress=+0.05 to +0.50)
- Vehicle movement: Still minimal (random exploration phase)
- Speed: Still low (random actions)
- Reward: Similar total, but now you can SEE progress contribution
```

**Important**: Vehicle movement won't improve much in first 200 steps because:
- Agent is in random exploration phase (first 25k steps)
- Actions are random, not learned
- This is EXPECTED and CORRECT behavior
- Progress reward IS working, just not having effect yet because policy not learned

---

### 7. Long-Term Training Test (Optional)

To see intelligent behavior and verify progress reward effectiveness:

```bash
# Train for 50k steps (past exploration phase)
docker run --rm --network host --runtime nvidia \
  -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all \
  -e PYTHONPATH=/workspace \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  td3-av-system:v2.1-python310 \
  python3 scripts/train_td3.py --scenario 0 --max-timesteps 50000 --save-models
```

**After 25k-50k steps, verify**:
- [ ] ‚úÖ Vehicle accelerates smoothly
- [ ] ‚úÖ Vehicle maintains forward movement
- [ ] ‚úÖ Progress reward consistently positive
- [ ] ‚úÖ Waypoint reached logs appear regularly
- [ ] ‚úÖ Total reward trending upward
- [ ] ‚úÖ Average speed increases over episodes

---

## Expected Results Summary

### Immediate (200-step test)
‚úÖ **FIXED**: Progress reward component now visible in output
‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPECTED**: Vehicle still not moving much (random exploration)
‚úÖ **WORKING**: Progress calculation functional (can see it change)

### After Training (50k steps)
‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Vehicle learns to move forward
‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Progress reward drives goal-directed behavior
‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Waypoints reached regularly
‚úÖ **EXPECTED**: Performance improves over time

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Progress always shows +0.00
**Check**:
1. Is distance_to_goal changing in PROGRESS section?
2. Is vehicle moving at all (check Speed)?
3. Look for errors in console about waypoint manager

**Likely cause**: Vehicle in exploration phase, random actions not moving forward

### Issue: Progress reward not visible
**Check**:
1. Did you rebuild the Docker image?
2. Are you using the new image (v2.1)?
3. Check that train_td3.py has the fix (lines ~465, ~490)

**Likely cause**: Using old Docker image without fix

### Issue: No waypoint logs appearing
**Check**:
1. How many steps have you run? (Waypoints ~5-10m apart)
2. Is vehicle moving forward? (Check Speed and WP1 distance)
3. Is current_waypoint_idx incrementing?

**Likely cause**: Vehicle not moving far enough to reach waypoints

### Issue: Python import errors
**Check**:
1. Is CARLA server running on port 2000?
2. Are all dependencies in Docker image?
3. Check container logs for errors

**Likely cause**: Environment setup issue

## Next Steps

After verifying the fix:

1. **If display fix verified** ‚úÖ:
   - Document success
   - Proceed with longer training
   - Monitor progress reward effectiveness

2. **If behavioral issues remain** after training:
   - Review hyperparameters (especially progress weight)
   - Check reward balance across components
   - Consider adjusting waypoint bonus or distance scale
   - Analyze episode logs for patterns

3. **If technical issues** ‚ùå:
   - Check error logs
