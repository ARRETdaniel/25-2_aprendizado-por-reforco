2. **`src/agents/td3_agent.py`** ✅ **MODIFIED** (Phase 2)
   - Added CNN parameter to `__init__()`
   - Added `use_dict_buffer` flag for buffer selection
   - Added CNN optimizer initialization
   - Created `extract_features()` method for gradient-enabled feature extraction
   - Modified `train()` to support Dict observations and CNN training
   - Updated `save_checkpoint()` to include CNN state
   - Updated `load_checkpoint()` to restore CNN state

---

## Detailed Changes to TD3Agent

### 1. Import DictReplayBuffer

**Location:** Line 28

```python
from src.utils.dict_replay_buffer import DictReplayBuffer
```

### 2. Modified __init__() Signature

**Location:** Lines 51-61

**Added Parameters:**
- `cnn_extractor: Optional[torch.nn.Module] = None` - CNN for end-to-end training
- `use_dict_buffer: bool = True` - Flag to enable DictReplayBuffer

**New Docstring:**
```python
"""
Args:
    ...
    cnn_extractor: CNN feature extractor for end-to-end training (optional)
                   If provided, enables gradient-based CNN learning
    use_dict_buffer: If True, use DictReplayBuffer for gradient flow
                     If False, use standard ReplayBuffer (no CNN training)
    ...
"""
```

### 3. CNN Initialization and Optimizer

**Location:** Lines 159-182 (after critic initialization)

```python
# Initialize CNN for end-to-end training (Bug #13 fix)
self.cnn_extractor = cnn_extractor
self.use_dict_buffer = use_dict_buffer

if self.cnn_extractor is not None:
    # CNN should be in training mode (NOT eval!)
    self.cnn_extractor.train()
    
    # Create CNN optimizer with lower learning rate
    cnn_config = config.get('networks', {}).get('cnn', {})
    cnn_lr = cnn_config.get('learning_rate', 1e-4)  # Conservative 1e-4 for CNN
    self.cnn_optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(
        self.cnn_extractor.parameters(),
        lr=cnn_lr
    )
    print(f"  CNN optimizer initialized with lr={cnn_lr}")
    print(f"  CNN mode: training (gradients enabled)")
else:
    self.cnn_optimizer = None
    if use_dict_buffer:
        print("  WARNING: DictReplayBuffer enabled but no CNN provided!")
```

**Key Points:**
- CNN set to `.train()` mode (NOT `.eval()` which was Bug #13)
- CNN optimizer uses conservative learning rate (1e-4 vs 3e-4 for actor/critic)
- Warning if DictReplayBuffer enabled but no CNN provided

### 4. Conditional Replay Buffer Initialization

**Location:** Lines 184-201

```python
# Initialize replay buffer (Dict or standard based on flag)
if use_dict_buffer and self.cnn_extractor is not None:
    # Use DictReplayBuffer for end-to-end CNN training
    self.replay_buffer = DictReplayBuffer(
        image_shape=(4, 84, 84),
        vector_dim=23,  # velocity(1) + lateral_dev(1) + heading_err(1) + waypoints(20)
        action_dim=action_dim,
        max_size=self.buffer_size,
        device=self.device
    )
    print(f"  Using DictReplayBuffer for end-to-end CNN training")
else:
    # Use standard ReplayBuffer (no CNN training)
    self.replay_buffer = ReplayBuffer(
        state_dim=state_dim,
        action_dim=action_dim,
        max_size=self.buffer_size,
        device=self.device
    )
    print(f"  Using standard ReplayBuffer (CNN not trained)")
```

**Key Points:**
- DictReplayBuffer only used if both `use_dict_buffer=True` AND `cnn_extractor` provided
- Falls back to standard ReplayBuffer otherwise (backward compatibility)

### 5. New extract_features() Method

**Location:** Lines 248-295 (after select_action)

```python
def extract_features(
    self,
    obs_dict: Dict[str, torch.Tensor],
    enable_grad: bool = True
) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Extract features from Dict observation with gradient support.
    
    This method combines CNN visual features with kinematic vector features.
    When enable_grad=True (training), gradients flow through CNN for end-to-end learning.
    When enable_grad=False (inference), CNN runs in no_grad mode for efficiency.
    
    Args:
        obs_dict: Dict with 'image' (B,4,84,84) and 'vector' (B,23) tensors
        enable_grad: If True, compute gradients for CNN (training mode)
                    If False, use torch.no_grad() for inference
    
    Returns:
        state: Flattened state tensor (B, 535) with gradient tracking if enabled
              = 512 (CNN features) + 23 (kinematic features)
    
    Note:
        This is the KEY method for Bug #13 fix. By extracting features WITH gradients
        during training, we enable backpropagation through the CNN, allowing it to learn
        optimal visual representations for the driving task.
    """
    if self.cnn_extractor is None:
        # No CNN provided - use zeros for image features (fallback, shouldn't happen)
        batch_size = obs_dict['vector'].shape[0]
        image_features = torch.zeros(batch_size, 512, device=self.device)
        print("WARNING: extract_features called but no CNN available!")
    elif enable_grad:
        # Training mode: Extract features WITH gradients
        # Gradients will flow: loss → actor/critic → state → CNN
        image_features = self.cnn_extractor(obs_dict['image'])  # (B, 512)
    else:
        # Inference mode: Extract features without gradients (more efficient)
        with torch.no_grad():
            image_features = self.cnn_extractor(obs_dict['image'])  # (B, 512)
    
    # Concatenate visual features with vector state
    # Result: (B, 535) = (B, 512) + (B, 23)
    state = torch.cat([image_features, obs_dict['vector']], dim=1)
    
    return state
```

**Key Points:**
- **Central method for Bug #13 fix**
- `enable_grad=True`: Computes CNN features WITH gradients (training)
- `enable_grad=False`: Uses `torch.no_grad()` for inference (efficient)
- Returns concatenated state: 512 (CNN) + 23 (vector) = 535 dimensions

### 6. Modified train() Method

**Location:** Lines 297-403

**Key Changes:**

#### A. Conditional Sampling

```python
# Sample replay buffer
if self.use_dict_buffer and self.cnn_extractor is not None:
    # DictReplayBuffer returns: (obs_dict, action, next_obs_dict, reward, not_done)
    obs_dict, action, next_obs_dict, reward, not_done = self.replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
    
    # Extract state features WITH gradients for training
    # This is the KEY to Bug #13 fix: gradients flow through CNN!
    state = self.extract_features(obs_dict, enable_grad=True)  # (B, 535)
else:
    # Standard ReplayBuffer returns: (state, action, next_state, reward, not_done)
    state, action, next_state, reward, not_done = self.replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
```

#### B. Target Computation with Feature Extraction

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    # Compute next_state for target Q-value calculation
    if self.use_dict_buffer and self.cnn_extractor is not None:
        # Extract next state features (no gradients for target computation)
        next_state = self.extract_features(next_obs_dict, enable_grad=False)
    # else: next_state already computed above from standard buffer
    
    # ... target computation continues ...
```

#### C. Critic Update with CNN Gradients

```python
# Optimize critics (gradients flow through state → CNN if using DictReplayBuffer!)
self.critic_optimizer.zero_grad()
if self.cnn_optimizer is not None:
    self.cnn_optimizer.zero_grad()  # Zero CNN gradients before backprop

critic_loss.backward()  # Gradients flow: critic_loss → state → CNN!

self.critic_optimizer.step()
if self.cnn_optimizer is not None:
    self.cnn_optimizer.step()  # UPDATE CNN WEIGHTS!
```

**Critical Point:** This is where CNN weights are updated! Gradients flow:
```
critic_loss → current_Q1/Q2 → state → CNN → CNN.parameters()
```

#### D. Actor Update with CNN Gradients

```python
# Delayed policy updates
if self.total_it % self.policy_freq == 0:
    # Re-extract features for actor update (need fresh computational graph)
    if self.use_dict_buffer and self.cnn_extractor is not None:
        state_for_actor = self.extract_features(obs_dict, enable_grad=True)
    else:
        state_for_actor = state  # Use same state from standard buffer
    
    # Compute actor loss: -Q1(s, μ_φ(s))
    actor_loss = -self.critic.Q1(state_for_actor, self.actor(state_for_actor)).mean()

    # Optimize actor (gradients flow through state_for_actor → CNN!)
    self.actor_optimizer.zero_grad()
    if self.cnn_optimizer is not None:
        self.cnn_optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    actor_loss.backward()  # Gradients flow: actor_loss → state → CNN!
    
    self.actor_optimizer.step()
    if self.cnn_optimizer is not None:
        self.cnn_optimizer.step()  # UPDATE CNN WEIGHTS AGAIN!
    
    # ... target network updates ...
```

**Critical Point:** CNN updated TWICE per policy update cycle:
1. Once during critic update
2. Once during actor update

This ensures CNN learns from both value estimation AND policy optimization signals!

### 7. Updated save_checkpoint()

**Location:** Lines 405-425

```python
checkpoint = {
    'total_it': self.total_it,
    'actor_state_dict': self.actor.state_dict(),
    'critic_state_dict': self.critic.state_dict(),
    'actor_optimizer_state_dict': self.actor_optimizer.state_dict(),
    'critic_optimizer_state_dict': self.critic_optimizer.state_dict(),
    'config': self.config,
    'use_dict_buffer': self.use_dict_buffer  # Store buffer type flag
}

# Add CNN state if available (Bug #13 fix)
if self.cnn_extractor is not None:
    checkpoint['cnn_state_dict'] = self.cnn_extractor.state_dict()
    if self.cnn_optimizer is not None:
        checkpoint['cnn_optimizer_state_dict'] = self.cnn_optimizer.state_dict()

torch.save(checkpoint, filepath)
print(f"Checkpoint saved to {filepath}")
if self.cnn_extractor is not None:
    print(f"  Includes CNN state for end-to-end training")
```

### 8. Updated load_checkpoint()

**Location:** Lines 427-460

```python
# Restore CNN state if available (Bug #13 fix)
if 'cnn_state_dict' in checkpoint and self.cnn_extractor is not None:
    self.cnn_extractor.load_state_dict(checkpoint['cnn_state_dict'])
    if 'cnn_optimizer_state_dict' in checkpoint and self.cnn_optimizer is not None:
        self.cnn_optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['cnn_optimizer_state_dict'])
    print(f"  CNN state restored")
```

## Gradient Flow Diagram

### Before Bug #13 Fix (BROKEN)

```
Training Step:
1. Sample from ReplayBuffer → numpy state (535-dim)
2. Convert to tensor (NEW tensor, no gradient history)
3. Critic/Actor forward pass
4. Loss.backward()
5. Gradients flow to actor/critic ONLY
6. CNN never updated (frozen at initialization)
```

### After Bug #13 Fix (WORKING)

```
Training Step:
1. Sample from DictReplayBuffer → Dict{'image': tensor, 'vector': tensor}
2. extract_features(enable_grad=True) → state tensor WITH gradients
3. Critic forward: state → Q-value
4. critic_loss.backward()
5. Gradients flow: critic_loss → state → CNN!
6. CNN optimizer updates CNN weights ✅

(Every policy_freq steps)
7. Re-extract features with gradients
8. Actor forward: state → action
9. actor_loss.backward()
10. Gradients flow: actor_loss → state → CNN!
11. CNN optimizer updates CNN weights again ✅
```

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests (Recommended)

```python
# Test 1: DictReplayBuffer storage and sampling
buffer = DictReplayBuffer(...)
buffer.add(obs_dict, action, next_obs_dict, reward, done)
obs_dict, action, next_obs_dict, reward, not_done = buffer.sample(32)
assert obs_dict['image'].requires_grad == False  # Tensors from buffer don't require grad by default
assert isinstance(obs_dict['image'], torch.Tensor)

# Test 2: CNN feature extraction with gradients
obs_dict = {'image': torch.randn(32, 4, 84, 84), 'vector': torch.randn(32, 23)}
state = agent.extract_features(obs_dict, enable_grad=True)
assert state.shape == (32, 535)
# Create dummy loss and backprop
loss = state.sum()
loss.backward()
# Check CNN has gradients
for param in agent.cnn_extractor.parameters():
    assert param.grad is not None

# Test 3: Training step updates CNN weights
cnn_params_before = [p.clone() for p in agent.cnn_extractor.parameters()]
agent.train(batch_size=32)
cnn_params_after = list(agent.cnn_extractor.parameters())
# Verify at least one parameter changed
assert any(not torch.equal(p1, p2) for p1, p2 in zip(cnn_params_before, cnn_params_after))
```

### Integration Test (1000-step diagnostic run)

```bash
cd av_td3_system
python scripts/train_td3.py --scenario 0 --max-timesteps 1000 --debug --device cpu
```

**Expected Observations:**
- ✅ Agent initialization shows "Using DictReplayBuffer for end-to-end CNN training"
- ✅ CNN optimizer initialized with lr=1e-4
- ✅ Vehicle moves (speed > 0 km/h)
- ✅ Episode rewards vary (not constant -53)
- ✅ No gradient-related errors

---

## Next Steps: Phase 3

### Modify Training Loop (train_td3.py)

**Required Changes:**

1. **Pass CNN to TD3Agent** (Lines 175-207)
   ```python
   # Initialize agent WITH CNN
   self.agent = TD3Agent(
       state_dim=535,
       action_dim=2,
       max_action=1.0,
       cnn_extractor=self.cnn_extractor,  # ← ADD THIS!
       use_dict_buffer=True,                # ← ADD THIS!
       config=td3_config,
       device=args.device
   )
   ```

2. **Store Dict Observations Directly** (Lines 515-580)
   ```python
   # Store Dict observation in buffer (NOT flattened!)
   self.agent.replay_buffer.add(
       obs_dict=obs,           # ← Dict observation!
       action=action,
       next_obs_dict=next_obs,  # ← Dict observation!
       reward=reward,
       done=done or truncated
   )
   ```

3. **Keep flatten_dict_obs() for Inference Only**
   - Used for action selection only
   - NOT used for replay buffer storage
   - Keep `torch.no_grad()` context (inference mode)

---

## Configuration Update Required

Add CNN learning rate to `config/td3_config.yaml`:

```yaml
networks:
  cnn:
    learning_rate: 0.0001  # Conservative 1e-4 for CNN
  actor:
    hidden_layers: [256, 256]
    learning_rate: 0.0003
  critic:
    hidden_layers: [256, 256]
    learning_rate: 0.0003
```

---

## Expected Impact After Full Implementation

| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| CNN Training | ❌ Frozen | ✅ Learning | Enabled |
| Vehicle Speed | 0 km/h | > 5 km/h | +5 km/h |
| Episode Reward | -52,700 | > -30,000 | +22,700 |
| Success Rate | 0% | > 5% | +5% |
| Visual Features | Random | Meaningful | Useful |

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Memory Usage

**Issue:** DictReplayBuffer stores images (~4x larger than features)

**Mitigation:**
- Start with smaller buffer (250K → 1M)
- Monitor memory usage during training
- Can fall back to standard buffer if needed

### Training Speed

**Issue:** CNN forward pass in training loop (slower)

**Mitigation:**
- Profile CNN forward time
- Consider lighter CNN if needed
- Use GPU for CNN (should be fast enough)

### Gradient Issues

**Issue:** Potential gradient explosion/vanishing

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor CNN gradient norms (log in TensorBoard)
- Use gradient clipping if needed
- Conservative CNN learning rate (1e-4)

---

## Summary

✅ **Phase 2 Complete:** TD3Agent now fully supports end-to-end CNN training

**Key Achievements:**
1. DictReplayBuffer integration
2. CNN optimizer and training logic
3. Gradient-enabled feature extraction
4. Checkpoint support for CNN state
5. Backward compatibility (can still use standard buffer)

**Next:** Implement Phase 3 (modify train_td3.py) to complete Bug #13 fix!
