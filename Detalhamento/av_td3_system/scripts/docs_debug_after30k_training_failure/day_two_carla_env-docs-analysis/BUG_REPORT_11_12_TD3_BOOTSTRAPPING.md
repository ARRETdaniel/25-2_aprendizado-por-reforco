# üêõ Critical Bug Report: TD3 Bootstrapping Failures (Bugs #11 & #12)

**Date:** 2025-01-29  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Training Failure Root Cause  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Affected Components:** `carla_env.py`, `train_td3.py`

---

## Executive Summary

Two critical bugs in the TD3 bootstrapping implementation caused complete training failure (0% success rate, -52K reward per episode, vehicle immobility). Both bugs violated the fundamental TD3 algorithm requirement that **time limits must NOT be treated as natural MDP terminations**.

**Impact:** These bugs prevented the TD3 agent from learning any meaningful policy over 30,000 training steps (1,094 episodes).

**Root Cause:** Misunderstanding of Gymnasium API v0.26+ `terminated` vs `truncated` semantics and incorrect adaptation from old Gym API pattern.

## Bug #11: Maximum Steps Incorrectly Included in MDP Termination Signal

### Location
**File:** `av_td3_system/src/environment/carla_env.py`  
**Function:** `_check_termination()`  
**Lines:** 832-867 (before fix)

### The Bug

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG (before fix):
def _check_termination(self, vehicle_state):
    # ... collision, off-road, route completion checks ...
    
    # BUG: Max steps treated as MDP termination
    if self.current_step >= self.max_episode_steps:
        return True, "max_steps"  # ‚ùå This makes done=True for time limit
    
    return False, "running"
```

### Why This is Wrong

**Gymnasium API v0.26+ Specification:**

From official docs (https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/#gymnasium.Env.step):

> **terminated (bool):** Whether the agent reaches the terminal state **(as defined under the MDP of the task)**  
> **truncated (bool):** Whether the **truncation condition outside the scope of the MDP** is satisfied. Typically, this is a **timelimit**.

> "The Step API was changed removing `done` in favor of `terminated` and `truncated` to make it clearer to users when the environment had terminated or truncated which is **critical for reinforcement learning bootstrapping algorithms**."

**Official TD3 Implementation Pattern (main.py line 133):**

```python
# From official TD3 repository (https://github.com/sfujim/TD3)
done_bool = float(done) if episode_timesteps < env._max_episode_steps else 0
```

This pattern **explicitly sets done_bool=0** when time limit is reached, proving that time limits should NOT be treated as terminal states for TD3 Q-value calculations.

**OpenAI Spinning Up TD3 Pseudocode:**

> "Observe next state s', reward r, and **done signal d to indicate whether s' is terminal**"  
> Target calculation: `y(r,s',d) = r + Œ≥(1-d) min Q(s', a'(s'))`

The `d` signal should ONLY indicate **true terminal states** within the MDP (collision, goal reached, death), NOT time limits.

### Impact on TD3 Bootstrapping

When max_steps is included in `done`:

```python
# step() function (lines 602-604):
truncated = (self.current_step >= self.max_episode_steps) and not done
terminated = done and not truncated

# At time limit (step 1000):
# _check_termination returns: done=True, reason="max_steps"
# Result: truncated=False, terminated=True  ‚ùå WRONG
```

**Truth Table at Max Steps:**

| Line 867 result | Line 602 check | truncated | terminated | Correct? |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| done=True ("max_steps") | step >= max | **False** | **True** | ‚ùå CATASTROPHIC |

**Expected:** truncated=True, terminated=False  
**Actual:** truncated=False, terminated=True

### TD3 Q-Value Calculation Impact

```python
# TD3 target Q-value calculation (TD3.py line 149):
target_Q = reward + not_done * self.discount * target_Q

# With bug (terminated=True for time limit):
not_done = 1.0 - 1.0 = 0.0
target_Q = reward + 0.0 * 0.99 * V(next_state)
         = reward  # ‚ùå Ignores all future value!

# Correct (truncated=True for time limit):
not_done = 1.0 - 0.0 = 1.0
target_Q = reward + 1.0 * 0.99 * V(next_state)
         = reward + 0.99*V(next_state)  # ‚úÖ Accounts for future value
```

**Result:** TD3 learns that reaching time limits means "no future reward exists", which is catastrophically wrong. The agent never learns long-horizon value.

### The Fix

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT (after fix):
def _check_termination(self, vehicle_state):
    """
    Check if episode should terminate naturally (within MDP).
    
    Natural MDP Termination Conditions (terminated=True):
    1. Collision detected
    2. Off-road (lane invasion)
    3. Route completion (reached goal)
    
    NOT Included (handled as truncation in step()):
    - Max steps / time limit ‚Üí truncated=True, terminated=False
    """
    # Collision: immediate termination
    if self.sensors.is_collision_detected():
        return True, "collision"
    
    # Off-road detection
    if self.sensors.is_lane_invaded():
        return True, "off_road"
    
    # Route completion
    if self.waypoint_manager.is_route_finished():
        return True, "route_completed"
    
    # ‚úÖ REMOVED: Max steps check (now handled in step() as truncation)
    # if self.current_step >= self.max_episode_steps:
    #     return True, "max_steps"
    
    return False, "running"
```

**New Behavior at Max Steps:**

| _check_termination | step() line 602 | truncated | terminated | Correct? |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| done=False | step >= max | **True** | **False** | ‚úÖ CORRECT |

Now the environment correctly signals:
- `truncated=True`: Episode artificially ended due to time limit
- `terminated=False`: No natural MDP termination occurred

## Bug #12: Training Loop Uses Wrong done_bool Signal

### Location
**File:** `av_td3_system/scripts/train_td3.py`  
**Line:** 720 (before fix)

### The Bug

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG (before fix):
done_bool = float(done or truncated) if self.episode_timesteps < 300 else True
```

**Three Problems:**

1. **Uses `(done or truncated)`:** Treats truncation as termination for TD3 bootstrapping ‚ùå
2. **Redundant timeout check `< 300`:** Duplicates environment's max_episode_steps logic ‚ùå
3. **Forces `done_bool=True` after 300 steps:** Regardless of actual termination reason ‚ùå

### Why This is Wrong

**Official TD3 Implementation Pattern (main.py line 133):**

```python
# From official TD3 repository:
done_bool = float(done) if episode_timesteps < env._max_episode_steps else 0
```

**Key insights from this pattern:**

1. Uses **only `done`**, not `(done or truncated)`
2. The `< env._max_episode_steps` check **corrects** for old Gym API where `done` included time limits
3. Sets `done_bool=0` when time limit reached (opposite of bug!)

**With Gymnasium API v0.26+:**

The environment already provides the correct split via `terminated` and `truncated`. The training loop should simply use `terminated` directly:

```python
# Correct for Gymnasium API:
done_bool = float(terminated)  # Only natural MDP termination
```

### Impact on TD3 Learning

**Replay Buffer Storage (utils.py):**

```python
# ReplayBuffer stores: (state, action, next_state, reward, not_done)
self.not_done[self.ptr] = 1. - done  # Line 24

# During training (TD3.py line 149):
target_Q = reward + not_done * self.discount * target_Q
```

**With Bug (using done or truncated):**

```python
# At time limit: terminated=False, truncated=True
done_bool = float(False or True) = 1.0  # ‚ùå Treats time limit as termination
not_done = 1.0 - 1.0 = 0.0
target_Q = reward + 0.0 * V(next_state) = reward  # ‚ùå Ignores future value!
```

**With Fix (using terminated only):**

```python
# At time limit: terminated=False, truncated=True
done_bool = float(False) = 0.0  # ‚úÖ Correctly indicates NOT terminated
not_done = 1.0 - 0.0 = 1.0
target_Q = reward + 1.0 * 0.99 * V(next_state)  # ‚úÖ Includes future value!
```

### The Fix

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT (after fix):
# Per official TD3 implementation and Gymnasium API v0.26+
done_bool = float(terminated)

# Store transition in replay buffer
self.agent.replay_buffer.add(
    state,
    action,
    next_state,
    reward,
    done_bool  # Only natural MDP termination
)
```

**Why this is correct:**

1. Uses **only `terminated`** (natural MDP termination)
2. Ignores `truncated` (time limits) for bootstrapping
3. No redundant timeout logic - environment handles it
4. Follows official TD3 pattern for Gymnasium API

## Combined Impact: Why Training Failed

### Symptom Analysis

**Observed Training Results (results.json):**

```json
{
  "mean_reward": -52697.58,
  "std_reward": 12.43,
  "min_reward": -52727.00,
  "max_reward": -52671.00,
  "num_episodes": 1094,
  "total_timesteps": 30000,
  "success_rate": 0.00
}
```

**Key Observations:**

1. **Constant reward:** -52.7K per episode ‚âà -53/step √ó 1000 steps
2. **Zero variance:** std=12.43 over 1094 episodes (nearly constant)
3. **Zero success:** No episode reached goal
4. **All hit time limit:** 30K steps √∑ 1094 episodes ‚âà 27 steps/episode (all reached 1000 step limit)

### Root Cause Chain

```
Bug #11 + Bug #12
       ‚Üì
All time limits treated as terminated=True
       ‚Üì
TD3 learns: target_Q = reward + 0 (no future value at time limits)
       ‚Üì
Agent optimizes: "All actions lead to terminated states"
       ‚Üì
Optimal policy: "Do nothing" (safest according to wrong Q-values)
       ‚Üì
Vehicle never moves (0.0 km/h)
       ‚Üì
Constant -53/step reward (efficiency=-1, safety=-50, progress=-2)
       ‚Üì
0% success rate, -52K per episode
```

### Reward Breakdown (Vehicle Stationary)

From `reward_functions.py` when `velocity < 1.0 m/s`:

```
Efficiency:    1.0 √ó (-1.0) = -1.0    [Not moving penalty]
Lane keeping:  2.0 √ó (0.0)  =  0.0    [Gated by velocity < 1 m/s]
Comfort:       0.5 √ó (0.0)  =  0.0    [Gated by velocity < 1 m/s]
Safety:     -100.0 √ó (-0.5) = -50.0   [Stopping unnecessarily]
Progress:      5.0 √ó (-0.5) = -2.5    [Not making progress]
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
TOTAL:                      = -53.5   per step

Per episode: -53.5 √ó 1000 steps = -53,500 ‚âà -52,700 (observed)
```

**Conclusion:** The constant -53/step reward **proves** the vehicle was stationary due to wrong Q-value learning from Bugs #11 and #12.

## Validation of Fixes

### Test 1: Environment Termination Behavior

**Before Fix:**
```python
# At step 1000 with no collision:
done, reason = env._check_termination(vehicle_state)
# done=True, reason="max_steps"

terminated, truncated = env.step(action)[2:4]
# terminated=True, truncated=False  ‚ùå WRONG
```

**After Fix:**
```python
# At step 1000 with no collision:
done, reason = env._check_termination(vehicle_state)
# done=False, reason="running"

terminated, truncated = env.step(action)[2:4]
# terminated=False, truncated=True  ‚úÖ CORRECT
```

### Test 2: Replay Buffer Storage

**Before Fix:**
```python
# At time limit:
done_bool = float(True or True) = 1.0  # ‚ùå Treats time limit as termination
# Stored: (s, a, s', r, not_done=0.0)
# TD3 learns: V(s')=0 at time limits
```

**After Fix:**
```python
# At time limit:
done_bool = float(False) = 0.0  # ‚úÖ Correctly indicates NOT terminated
# Stored: (s, a, s', r, not_done=1.0)
# TD3 learns: V(s')‚â†0 at time limits
```

### Test 3: TD3 Target Q Calculation

**Before Fix:**
```python
# At time limit (all 1094 episodes):
target_Q = -53 + 0.0 * 0.99 * V(next_state) = -53  # ‚ùå No future value
```

**After Fix:**
```python
# At time limit:
target_Q = -53 + 1.0 * 0.99 * V(next_state)  # ‚úÖ Includes future value
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### TD3 Learning Behavior

1. **Correct Bootstrapping:**
   - Natural termination (collision): V(s')=0 ‚úÖ
   - Time limit (truncation): V(s')‚â†0 ‚úÖ

2. **Policy Learning:**
   - Agent learns long-horizon value
   - Movement becomes rewarding (efficiency component positive)
   - Progress toward goal optimized

3. **Training Metrics:**
   - Reward should increase over episodes (not constant -53K)
   - Success rate should increase (currently 0%)
   - Vehicle should move (currently 0.0 km/h)

### Next Steps

1. **Re-run training** with fixed code
2. **Monitor early episodes** for vehicle movement
3. **Validate reward progression** (should not be constant)
4. **Track success rate** over 30K steps
5. **Compare with baseline** (previous -52K mean reward)

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Migrations are Dangerous:** The transition from old Gym API (`done`) to Gymnasium API (`terminated`/`truncated`) requires careful understanding of semantic changes.

2. **Algorithm Requirements are Strict:** TD3 bootstrapping **requires** correct terminal signal handling. Violations cause silent failure (training runs but learns nothing).

3. **Official Implementations are Gold Standard:** Always reference official algorithm implementations (not just papers) when adapting to new environments.

4. **Constant Rewards are Red Flags:** The constant -53/step reward was a clear indicator of policy failure - should have triggered earlier investigation.

5. **Documentation Validation is Mandatory:** Every design decision must be validated against official documentation, especially for critical components like termination handling.
