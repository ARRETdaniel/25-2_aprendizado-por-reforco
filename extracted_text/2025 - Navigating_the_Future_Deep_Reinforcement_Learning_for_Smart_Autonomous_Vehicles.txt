ABSTRACT:  
 
Intelligent transportation is gaining much attention 
about autonomous driving systems. This research 
will present a fully developed comprehensive 
framework to implement the navigation of 
autonomous vehicles using CARLA. Deep 
learning-based object detection by the use of 
YOLOv5 is used in the current project, which 
identifies both real-time vehicle traffic, traffic 
lights, and obstacles. In parallel, lane detection is 
achieved through image processing techniques, 
such as edge detection and Hough Line Transform. 
The proposed system integrates these capabilities 
with decision-making algorithms to facilitate 
responsive vehicle control in dynamic 
environments.  In addition, the validation of 
autonomous behaviour from a holistic point of view 
uses third-party camera views. Multiple vehicle 
traffic simulations add realism to the environment. 
A pilot function simulates the actual condition, with 
a synchronized simulation approach for the correct 
timing in processing and analysing data. The 
outputs include saved images, processed frames, 
and videos demonstrating the efficacy of the system 
under varying scenarios.  This research  integrates 
modern computer vision techniques with simulated 
environments to create a robust testing platform for 
autonomous navigation. Future research can extend 
this framework to real-world applications or 
incorporate advanced reinforcement learning   
 
algorithms for enhanced decision-making 
capabilities.

algorithms can be tested under diverse and realistic 
scenarios. Among these, CARLA, an open -source 
simulator, has become a leading choice for 
autonomous driving research due to its 
photorealistic environments, flexi ble APIs, and 
extensive support for perception and control system 
integration.  
 
This paper presents a strong pipeline for 
autonomous navigation using the CARLA 
simulator, which incorporates advanced computer 
vision and deep learning techniques. The real -time 
object detection is performed using YOLOv5, one 
of the most advanced deep lea rning models, which 
is known for its efficiency and accuracy. The 
classical computer vision method of lane detection 
is also employed, using edge detection and Hough 
Line Transform, ensuring lane integrity. The 
combination of these components ensures safe and 
efficient navigation in dynamic environments.  
 
Third -party camera views and dynamic traffic 
simulations are used to validate the performance of 
the system in an all -rounded way. Furthermore, the 
simulation mode allows for a synchronized 
simulation mode, which is critical for real -time 
decision -making. With the use of CARLA's 
capabilities, this research underscores the potential 
of simulation -based development in overcoming 
key challenges in autonomous driving and paving 
the way for future advancements in intelligent 
transportation systems.

III.  METHODOLOGY  
 
This section of the research  explains the structured 
methodology that was followed in designing and 
implementing the autonomous driving system by 
utilizing CARLA simulation. The methodology 
involves integration of several key components: 
setting up the simulation environment, object 
detection using YOLOv5, lane detection through 
computer vision techniques, decision -making for 
vehicle control, and the validation process.  
 
 
 
Simulation Environment Setup  
The CARLA simulator is the backbone of this work, 
providing an environment for simulating and 
validating the behavio ur of autonomous vehicles in 
a realistic manner. The simulation is set to load the 
Town10HD map, including various urban scenarios 
that involve intersections, traffic lights, and 
dynamic  obstacles  
 
 
Fig 1: Lane Detection in Carla  
The red lines indicate the lanes on the road 
detected by the camera attached to the car.  
 
The simulation was set to operate in synchronous 
mode to ensure consistency in sensor data collection 
and processing. A fixed time step of 0.05 seconds 
was chosen to achieve a frame rate of 20 FPS, balancing computational requirements and real -time 
performance.  
 
Vehicle Deployment: The experimental vehicle was 
a Tesla Model 3 blueprint. It was fitted with onboard 
sensors, which included a forward -facing RGB 
camera for perception tasks and a third -party camera 
mounted behind the vehicle for external observation 
and data validation.  
 
Traffic Simulation: Fifteen autopiloted traffic 
vehicles were spawned in the environment to create 
realistic road conditions. These vehicles were 
randomly assigned spawn points and operated 
independently to simulate real -world traffic 
dynamics.

Additional veh icles are spawned onto the road 
for the purpose of creating obstacles for testing 
the detection mechanism.  
 
 
Object Detection Using YOLOv5  
Object detection is critical for enabling situational 
awareness in autonomous vehicles. The pretrained 
YOLOv5s model was integrated into the system to 
identify key traffic elements such as vehicles, traffic 
lights, and pedestrians.

The CARLA camera images are processed from 
RGB format into NumPy arrays compatible with 
YOLOv5 model. Bounding boxes, labels, and their 
respective confidence scores resulted from the 
model are parsed using pandas data frames for the 
next steps in decision -making.  
 
Important aspects in object detection involved:  
 
Traffic Light Detection: Traffic light detection with 
its states such as red, yellow, and green. Red light 
detection logic was provided, where vehicle braking 
was simulated once a red light was detected.  
Vehicle Detection: Bounding boxes were used to 
estimate the distance between the autonomous 
vehicle and detected objects. A simplified 
proportional relationship between bounding box 
height and object distance was employed to 
determine whether braking was r equired.  
 
Lane Detection and Road Navigation  
Lane detection ensures that the autonomous vehicle 
maintains its course within designated lanes. A 
multi -step approach was adopted:  
 
Grayscale Conversion: RGB camera images were 
converted into grayscale for simplicity in the 
operations that follow.  
Edge Detection: The Canny edge detection 
algorithm was used for lane boundaries 
enhancement.  
ROI mask: a polygonal ROI mask was defined so 
that it targets the segment ahead of the road, 
avoiding extraneous areas.  
Hough Line Transform: Lines representing the lane 
markings are detected using probabilistic Hough 
Line Transform. The detected lanes are overlaid on 
the original images for better visualization.

Decision and Vehicle Control Module  
The module for decision was the central control 
module of the autonomous navigation; it combined 
input from object detection and lane detection to 
regulate vehicle behavio ur. 
 
Braking Logic: The throttle of the vehicle was 
cut down, and brakes were applied when any red 
traffic signal was detected or if another vehicle was 
at safety distance defined (for example, 5 meters).  
Steering Control: Although lane detection was 
providing visual feedback on roads, steering control 
was maintained by autopilot feature for simplicity in 
this implementation. Custom control module may be 
used in place of it in future versions.

Validation and Evaluation  
 
Validation was performed using dual perspectives: 
onboard camera feeds and third -party camera 
observations.  
Onboard Camera: The front -facing camera 
provided real -time perception data, which was 
processed and analy sed to detect objects and lanes. 
Images were saved at regular intervals for offline 
inspection.  
Third -Party Camera: Positioned behind the vehicle, 
the third -party camera recorded its movement and 
interaction with traffic. These recordings facilitated 
qualitative assessments of the vehicle’s behavio ur. 
Two kinds of outputs were created for validation 
purposes:  
 
Processed Images: This comprised of the bounding 
boxes of the detected objects and overlaid lane 
markings that were saved in an output folder for 
debugging and visualization purposes.  
Video Recordings: Videos were produced from the 
saved images to showcase the system's performance 
over time.  
System Implementation Details  
Implementation was done in Python with some key 
libraries as follows:  
 
CARLA API: for control of the simulation and 
acquiring sensor data  
OpenCV: for image processing and visualization.  
Torch and YOLOv5 -Deep Learning based object

IV . RESULT AND DISCUSSION:  
 
The autonomous vehicle system was tested to 
navigate complex scenarios in the CARLA 
simulation. Key observations from the experiment 
are summarized below:  
 Object Detection: The YOLOv5 model was accurate 
in detecting traffic elements, such as vehicles and 
traffic lights. Bounding boxes were well drawn, and 
confidence scores generally exceeded 0.8, showing 
reliable detection.  
Red traffic lights were detected each time, resulting 
in appropriate braking responses.  
Vehicles were detected up to a simulated distance of 
50 meters, while braking was triggered when the 
distance went below 5 meters.  
Lane Detection: Lane markings were correctly 
identified for most conditions including curves and 
intersections. The ROI mask filtered noise 
effectively, meaning lane detection targeted the 
drivable area.  
Overlaid processed images with the original frames 
displayed well -delineated lane markings.  
The system failed at times in the extreme lighting 
conditions, such as low visibility or glare, and can 
be improved in the next versions.  
Traffic Interaction: The vehicle moved very 
smoothly through the traffic without collision and 
followed all the rules of traffic. The third -party 
camera footage confirmed that the system 
maintained a safe distance from other vehicles and 
responded to dynam ic obstacles.  
Performance Metrics:  
The simulation resulted in an average frame rate of 
20 FPS, which is consistent with the predefined time 
step. Object detection latency was minimal, 
ensuring real -time processing and control.  
 
The results confirm the effectiveness of the 
proposed system in integrating object detection and 
lane detection for autonomous navigation. The 
CARLA simulation provided a realistic testing 
environment, allowing the evaluation of the 
vehicle's behaviour under diverse conditions.

The results confirm the effectiveness of the 
proposed system in integrating object detection and 
lane detection for autonomous navigation. The 
CARLA simulation provided a realistic testing 
environment, allowing the evaluation of the 
vehicle's behaviour under diverse conditions.  
 
One of the key strengths of the system is its modular 
design, which would allow for the seamless 
integration of advanced algorithms or additional 
sensors. However, it has limitations, such as the 
reliance on a single camera for perception and the 
simplifie d braking logic. Real -world applications 
may require multi -sensor fusion and more 
sophisticated decision -making modules.  
Future directions could involve reinforcement 
learning for the optimization of control strategies or 
using LiDAR data for better depth perception. 
Another area is in addressing edge cases and 
making it resilient to scenarios such as adverse 
weather conditi ons or complex traffic scenarios.  
 
The complexity lies in the choice of image 
resolution, modle size, hardware, traffic density and 
scene complexity which significantly increases the 
computational cost of the overall system.

different models like MoblieNetV2 and

Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of 
using CARLA simulation and state -of-the-art vision 
algorithms to develop scalable autonomous driving 
systems. These findings contribute to the growing 
body of research in intelligent transportation and 
autonomous vehicle development.  
 
The issues that occurred during research are 
simplified decision making, limited perception, lack 
of robustness, computational demands and most 
importantly requirem ent of data.  
 
V .  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE  
 
This research illustrates an autonomous driving 
system using the CARLA simulation platform, 
integrating YOLOv5 for object detection and 
OpenCV for lane detection to navigate urban 
environments and adhere to traffic rules. Its modular 
design allows for scal ability and future 
enhancements for complex scenarios such as multi -
lane highways. However, its dependence on one 
RGB camera and limitations in performance when 
ambient light or surrounding conditions are bad, in 
addition to having braking logic not accoun ting for

requirement of high computational power is the 
main limitation also large amount of datasets are 
required for training the model to work accurately 
in real time. To fully unlock the potential of self -

vehicles perceive their surroundings, make driving 
decisions and handle diverse weather conditions. 
This involves enhancing multi -sensor data fusion, 
developing smarter A I for predicting road user 
behaviour and improvin g lane detection through 
techniques like semantic segmentation. Accurate 
testing in realistic virtual environments, using tools 
like CARLA simulation platform, alongside real -
world trials, will be crucial for ensuring safety, 
efficiency, and scalability of  these intelligent and 
versatile autonomous vehicle systems.
